## Abstract

The ever-increasing influence of automation in various branches of industry makes the acquisition of technological competencies a key element for the success of future generations of students.

However, despite efforts to reform education, much of the current teaching system continues to prepare students for the future by using methods from the past. Current educational curricula often lack opportunities to provide interdependencies between individual areas of engineering. Trainees are often unable to establish connections between them. By providing an appropriate and approachable entry point, the versatile field of designing robotic systems could be made more accessible to aspiring engineers.

As an approach, in the present thesis, the development of a prototype of a parallel kinematic machine, a Delta-robot, is presented. The system integrates knowledge from mechanics, electrical engineering and computer science. To allow a modular structure, the entity is realized via ''smart'' drives. The robot can thus be dynamically changed upon request to be customized to specific tasks. The drives facilitate the development, as the robot can be modulated quickly and inexpensively. In addition, the modular hardware in combination with open source software does neither require any specialized industrial equipment nor research establishments to impart practice-oriented content and research opportunities.

As a result, through the interaction of these advantages, a prototype for didactic purposes in academic education can be manufactured in an intrinsically safe, portable and cost-effective manner to give prospective engineers the unique opportunity of studying parallel kinematic machines in a practical way.
